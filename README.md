Updates Flash embeds to use HTML5-compatible embed codes. 

Currently works with Vimeo and YouTube videos, replacing any Flash embed code it finds on the page with their respective HTML5 iframe embed code. Code has been structured to easily add more services in the future, documentation coming soon.

By default, the extension runs at the end of every page load. However, in the settings you can turn that off, in which case you can run Embedinator manually by clicking on the Embedinate toolbar button.

Special thanks to the guys over at [Glyphish](http://glyphish.com/) for their free icon, and to John Resig for his [JavaScript simple templating library](http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-micro-templating/).
